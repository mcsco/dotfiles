# dotfiles

## Description
My personal dotfiles for bash and zsh. This repo will be a constant work in progress. My current shell of choice is zsh so it will be the main focus for my dotfiles.

## Getting started

Clone Repo
```
git clone git@gitlab.com:mcsco/dotfiles.git
```

Run Setup Script **STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS**
```
chmod +x setup.sh 
./setup.sh
```
